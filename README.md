# MarkdownToHtml

Job to convert markdown files to HTML in a given directory

Run this with the argument of a directory where you want to convert .md or .markdown files into HTML. Recursive by default or `--recursive=False` to remove that.

Might be useful for something like Google Drive, where the .md files are not readable from mobile - you'll get an HTML file that you can view from your phone.

You can throw this on a timer on Windows Task Scheduler to run every hour or so - runs pretty quickly.
